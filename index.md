## How to Install  
Simply open your ComputerCraft computer, and run these two commands:  
1. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobotLeopard86/dungyOS/main/Installer/install_dungy.lua  
2. install_dungy  

Be sure that the HTTP API is enabled and that you have a network connection.  

Note: The installer uses the GitHub API. This is limited to 60 requests per hour. If you have run out of API requests, you have to wait until they refresh. The installer will tell you how long that will be. And since the program needs internet connectivity, ensure that your internet is on while the installation is running.  

Another Note: Don't turn off the computer during installation or post-install setup. That will break the install.
